##Hardware

The DSL Sensor Mote is a sensor shield for the Arduino Leonardo.  Included on this board are a motion detector, microphone, light sensor, air pressure sensor, and a temperature and humidity sensor.  There are two versions of the board - the [Sensor Mote Air Quality](http://kippkitts.gostorego.com/sensor-mote-aq.html), which also includes an MQ135 Air Quality Sensor, and the [Sensor Mote RF](http://kippkitts.gostorego.com/sensor-mote-rf.html), which can measure RF signal strength.  The shield also features an XBee 802.15.4 radio for wireless transmission of data.
